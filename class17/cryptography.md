* __Caesar cipher__:
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.[1]  

* __Diffie-Herman Key Exchange__:
[Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange)   
It is a method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel and was one of the first public-key protocols as conceived by Ralph Merkle and named after Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman.DH is one of the earliest practical examples of public key exchange implemented within the field of cryptography.
