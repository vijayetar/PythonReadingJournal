[Home](../README.md) 

[Reference](https://sass-lang.com/guide)  

[Installation](https://sass-lang.com/install)  

[CheatSheet](https://devhints.io/sass)

[Sass in Django](https://github.com/jrief/django-sass-processor#introduction)  
[Nextjs component and globas css](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-3#built-in-sass-css-module-support-for-component-level-styles)  

 - npm install sass
 - create pages/_app.js
 - copy and paste the contents from the blog
 - apply it globally (for this you will have to build again)
 - after that your modularization works well as well

You can also use - bootstrap, bulma, tailwindcss, skeleton, material ui.

In terminal:
-npx create-next-app my_app-tailwind
- choose with-tailwindcss
- this will add postcss.config.js  and tailwind.config.js
