Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
Client-side routing with optimized prefetching
Built-in CSS and Sass support, and support for any CSS-in-JS library
Development environment which supports Hot Module Replacement

Fully extendable
Next.js is used in tens of thousands of production-facing websites and web applications, including many of the world's largest brands.
