## Stack
* Stacks are useful in understanding  of how interpreter works 
* we see examples of it during the call stack, in recursive functions, and with interpreter
* we are limited by the RAM available for multiple stacks causing stack overflow.
* Push - BigO(1)  
* Pop - BigO(1)  
* Peek - BigO(1)  
* IsEmpty - BigO(1)  
* Linked List with limitations that are deliberatly introduced so that we can take advantage of the BigO(1)
