* A __graph__ : A non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.  
* __Vertex__ : A node with zero or more adjacent vertices.  
* __Edge__ - Connection between two nodes.
* __Neighbor__ :  Adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.  
* __Degree__ : The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.  
* __Undirected Graph__ : A graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. 
* __Directed Graph__ : Also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed
* __Complete graph__ : When all nodes are connected to all other nodes.
* __Connected graph__ : Graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.
* __Disconnected graph__ : Graph where some vertices may not have edges.
* __A cycle__ : When a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.  A cycle is defined as a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex.
* __Weighted graph__ : When the connections(“edges”) between each node have a different weighted value assigned to them and you can create a weighted matrix that replaces the “1” and “0” with the actual weight values between the two nodes
