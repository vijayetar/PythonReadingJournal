# Dependency Injection  
### There are basically three types of dependency injection:  
* __constructor injection__: the dependencies are provided through a class constructor.  
* __setter injection__: the client exposes a setter method that the injector uses to inject the dependency.  
* __interface injection__: the dependency provides an injector method that will inject the dependency into any client passed to it. Clients must implement an interface that exposes a setter method that accepts the dependency.  

### So now its the dependency injectionâ€™s responsibility to:

* __Create__ the objects  
* Know which classes __require__ those objects  
* And __provide__ them all those objects
