Decorators provide a simple syntax for calling __higher-order functions__.

## Functions as First-Class Objects
In Python, functions are __first-class objects__. This means that functions can be passed around and used as arguments, just like any other object (string, int, float, list, and so on).  

Itâ€™s possible to define functions inside other functions. Such functions are called __inner functions__.  

The inner functions are not defined until the parent function is called. They are __locally scoped__ to parent(): __they only exist inside the parent() function as local variables__.

Python also allows you to use functions as return values, this means that you are returning a reference to the function.
