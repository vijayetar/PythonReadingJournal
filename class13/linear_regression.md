__Linear regression__ is a basic and commonly used type of predictive analysis.  The overall idea of regression is to examine two things: (1) does a set of predictor variables do a good job in predicting an outcome (dependent) variable?  (2) Which variables in particular are significant predictors of the outcome variable, and in what way do they–indicated by the magnitude and sign of the beta estimates–impact the outcome variable? 


## Types of Linear Regression
 

1. __Simple linear regression__:
1 dependent variable (interval or ratio), 1 independent variable (interval or ratio or dichotomous)

2. __Multiple linear regression__:
1 dependent variable (interval or ratio) , 2+ independent variables (interval or ratio or dichotomous)

3. __Logistic regression__:
1 dependent variable (dichotomous), 2+ independent variable(s) (interval or ratio or dichotomous)

4. __Ordinal regression__:
1 dependent variable (ordinal), 1+ independent variable(s) (nominal or dichotomous)

5. __Multinomial regression__:
1 dependent variable (nominal), 1+ independent variable(s) (interval or ratio or dichotomous)

6. __Discriminant analysis__:
1 dependent variable (nominal), 1+ independent variable(s) (interval or ratio)
